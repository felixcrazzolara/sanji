## sanji
### Description
sanji is C++ library heavily inspired by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). It was originally created out of the need to create quiver plots with an arrow size given in data units rather than pixel units. The number of features is still very limited, but will hopefully grow over time.

### Dependencies
sanji has a number of dependencies, which are listed below
- Qt5 or Qt6
- Eigen >=3.3
